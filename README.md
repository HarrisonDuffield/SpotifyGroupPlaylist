For When You Need to Vote on "Absolute Bangers"


Users joins a group of spotify freinds - given a group code

Each user within the group makes a playlist each week of 20 absolute bangers

The songs are then collated and put to all other memebers of the group , if the voting passes a defined threshold by the group admin(defaults to 100%) , then it is put in a absolute banger playlist to be shared with the whole group.

One user can be in multiple groups and submit the same playlist to different groups.


For voting : 

At first it will simply ask all members of the group if they agree the song should be an absolute banger,simple enough

The Proper one : 

Once this has been achevied the aim will then be to check the users liked songs to see if any of the songs put forward for the user to vote on have already been marked as a liked song by them(this will cut down on the amount of voting the user actually has to do themselves)

For songs which the user doesnt have in their liked songs, they will then be asked to vote on them . If they vote postiive they can be given the option to add it to the liked songs in their library so that they wont be asked about it again if they join other groups of freinds.


The final playlist once all the votes are taken will then be sent to all the members of the group.



Initally this will be focused on spotify,however i would like to include apple music aswell as youtube music, but this would be done simply by transferring the data fromt hose services to spotify processing the playlist with them and then back up to the service of choice. In a reverse order to how those discord bots work, although there might be a reason they work in that manner.


Will be a mobile site, and then if theres time just wrap it up.
